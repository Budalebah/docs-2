The technical discussion revolving SpiceNet is divided into several major areas:

* NOMT: Nearly Optimal Merkle Trees to solve state access bottlenecks.
* Deterministic STF and Sequencer: Deterministic state updates allowing for least downtine.
* Preferred and Based Sequencing: The secret sauce behind instant pre-confirmation, along with sequencer downtime protections,
* Optimistic vs ZK: What and Why?
* Execution Model Considerations
  * Sequential Execution ain't that bad.
  * VM? Or no VM?
* DA Layer Considerations
